This is my *third blog* post in Gatsby

# This should be an H1
I want to **bold something here**.
And then I would like to ~~create a list~~.
No, really. I want to create a list.
1. List item 1
2. List Item 2
  * unorderd sub list item
  * another sub list item
3. A third list item

I may need to insert something between my lists

* It seems like sub lists don't work with remark
